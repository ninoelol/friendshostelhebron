            <h3>if you come by service:</h3>
            <p>from all over the country you can reach hebron through services. <br> there are even direct services from yaffa to hebron sometimes</p>
            <p>when you are in the service to hebron, simply go until the end or tell them you need to get to the souk</p>
            <br>
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>is it dangerous to go to hebron?</h3>
        <p>no its not dangerous at all for tourists. you have full freedom of movement and a lot of privileges. do not worry at all.</p>
        <h3>how do i enter the westbank?</h3>
        <p>visiting the westbank is easy as nothing, you just come here xD. But all jokes aside you really just have to get in a bus or service to bethlehem or hebron directly from jerusalem or wherever youre coming from</p>
        <p>if you come from jerusalem to bethlehem you either go by bus and you wont even cross a checkpoint. 
            The other option is to go by service until the wall and cross the checkpoint (With a international passport and a visa for Israel no problem!) on foot and then walk to the city center and take a service from there. You can also take a taxi from the wall but they are very pushy and make sure to at least pass the first few ones, the ones farther away will give you better prices.</p>
        <p><h3>how is the situation in hebron special?</h3></p>
        <p>The settlements in the westbank are normally inbetween cities, whereas in hebron the settlement is right in the center of the old town, the heart of the city.</p>
        <p>when you travel to palestine it is a must to see what life in Hebron is like and how the occupation is impacting everybodies lifes.</p>
        <p><h3>how is the settlement affecting the city?</h3></p>
        <p>the city is split in half basically. After the massacre in the ibrahimi mosque in 1994 israel closed the shuhada street. The shuhada street was the most important street in hebron and now it is completely empty and no palestinean is allowed to walk on this street.</p>
        <p>go there and see it with youre own eyes.s</p>
